<?php
//Dudu uses an OOP approach to programming

  $Message = "I found it really interesting that Mark Zuckerberg at age 19 was able to make a social media site So i                   decided to try working on one to try and understand the main concepts behind some of the social media sites               we have";
  
  echo $Message;
?>

A couple of tips before setting up your project on your localhost server. There are a total of four MySql Connection Scripts. This is because i introduced some new plugins to the dudu system and preffered setting them up seperately from the main dudu framework for development purposes. 

** SETTING UP PROJECT **
Setting up the project on your localhost server is farely easy.
You'll simply change the connection script configs to match your localhost settings, don't forget to import the dudu.sql file dudu/dudu.sql 

Happy Coding

The files:
dudu/php_includes/db_conx.php
dudu/Connections/mysqli_connect.php
dudu/includes/db.php
dudu/vote_process.php

Also I would suggest clearing the tables once imported just so you can start with a clean database.

Any problem setting up project hit me up at malcolmmaima@gmail.com and help you out.
Have fun mess with the code as you wish
